Have all the settings!


Included are various config files for (neo)vim, tmux, bash and zsh.

Vim plugins are managed using vim-plug with neovim taking advantage of the async job control of NeoVim. Also, async linting and build tools with Neomake is so awesome. Feel free to take a look at some opinionated configuration in `.vimrc`

The main shell being used is zsh, with `antigen-hs` managing a couple of plugins. Fzf is a great tool I encourage you to check out.

There are also some bash config settings for those of you who can't quit it
(might be outdates)
