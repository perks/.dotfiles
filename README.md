Have all the settings!


Included are various config files for vim, tmux, bash and zsh.

Vim plugins are managed using the Vundle package manager, feel free to take a look at some opinionated configuration in `.vimrc`

The main shell being used is zsh, with `antigen-hs` managing a couple of plugins. Fzf is a great tool I encourage you to check out.

There are also some bash config settings for those of you who can't quit it.
